            "Solution:\nTo find the vertical asymptotes, we need to find the values of $x$ for which the denominator is equal to zero. We can do this by setting the denominator equal to zero and solving for $x$:\n\n$$x^2+x-6=0$$\n\nFactoring the quadratic, we get:\n\n$$(x+3)(x-2)=0$$\n\nThis gives us two possible values for $x$: $x=-3$ and $x=2$. Therefore, the graph of $y=\\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ has two vertical asymptotes at $x=-3$ and $x=2$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct."

Therefore, $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$.
