We need to apply this operation to the expressions `((t) \\Join (t+2))` and `((t+1) \\Join (t+1))`.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate `((t) \\Join (t+2))`:\n```\n((t) \\Join (t+2)) = ((t+2)(t+2-3)) = ((t+2)(t-1))\n```\nNext, let's evaluate `((t+1) \\Join (t+1))`:\n```\n((t+1) \\Join (t+1)) = ((t+1+2)((t+1)-3)) = ((t+3)(t-2))\n```\nNow, let's subtract the two expressions:\n```\n((t) \\Join (t+2)) - ((t+1) \\Join (t+1)) = ((t+2)(t-1)) - ((t+3)(t-2))\n```\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n```\n((t) \\Join (t+2)) - ((t+1) \\Join (t+1)) = (t^2-1) - (t^2-5) = -4\n```\nSo, the correct answer is -4.\n\n`Answer 3`: -4", "exception": "parse_raw_modif()  bad escape \\J at position 8"}
