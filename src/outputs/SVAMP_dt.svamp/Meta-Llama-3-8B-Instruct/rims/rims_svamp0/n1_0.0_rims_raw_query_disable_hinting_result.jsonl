You brilliantly detects the errors in the wrong solution and find `Workaround Method` to correct the solution. The methods you are taking are as follows. Each has its strength and weakness:\n\n- Chain of Thought (cot): Solving problem with writing steps of reasoning in a natural language. Might help correct understanding of the problem but this could be weaker in precise computation.\n- Program-aided Language Modeling (pal): Using python language to reason and obtain an accurate answer to the given question, but this could be weaker in understanding the problem.\n- Plan-and-then-Code (p2c): When a question seems requiring amount of steps to reach the answer, write plans first for what to compute and write a python code to it for solving the problem. However if planning goes wrong, the code will also be wrong. If any steps of planning provided before programming, then it will be considered as Plan-and-then-Code.\n\nFollowings are the examples of correcting the wrong solutions with a `Workaround Method` based on diagnosis (`Mistakes`).\n\n\n\n\n`Question`: There are 15 trees in the grove.
