Let's call the number of baseball cards she gave away \"x\". Then, she has 309 - x baseball cards left.\n\nSimilarly, she had 356 Ace cards and gave away some, but we don't know how many. Let's call the number of Ace cards she gave away \"x\". Then, she has 356 - x Ace cards left.\n\nWe know that the total number of cards she has left is 415, so we can set up the equation:\n309 - x + (356 - x) = 415\n\nCombine like terms:\n665 - 2x = 415\n\nAdd 2x to both sides:\n665 = 415 + 2x\n\nSubtract 415 from both sides:\n250 = 2x\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n125 = x\n\nSo, Nell gave away 125 cards of each type.

The grasshopper jumped 13 inches. The grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper.\nHow far did the frog jump?\n\n    Let's think step by step.\n    1. Let the distance the frog jumped be x.\n    2. The grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the grasshopper jumped 13 - 2 = 11 inches.\n    3. The grasshopper jumped 13 inches, so the total distance jumped by both is 11 + 13 = 24 inches.\n    4. The frog jumped x inches, so the total distance jumped by both is x + 11 inches.\n    5. Since the total distance jumped by both is the same, we can set up the equation: x + 11 = 24.\n    6. Solve for x: x = 24 - 11 = 13.\n    7.
