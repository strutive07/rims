Then, 82 children get on the bus. This makes a total of 28 + 82 = 110 children. However, we know that there are only 30 children on the bus in the end. This means that some children must have gotten off the bus. Let's call the number of children that got off x. Then, the number of children that got on is 82, and the number of children that are still on the bus is 30. We can set up the equation: 28 + 82 - x = 30. Solving for x, we get x = 60. This means that 60 children got off the bus. To find the difference between the number of children that got on and off the bus, we subtract 60 from 82: 82 - 60 = 22.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 22.

During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, they made 89 x 98 = 8712 dollars during the Arkansas game. But this is incorrect because we need to find the money made during the Arkansas game, not the total amount of money made.\n\nLet's recalculate:\nThe total amount of money made is 163 x 98 = 15994 dollars. The amount of money made during the Texas tech game is 163 - 89 = 74 t-shirts x 98 dollars per t-shirt = 7288 dollars. So, the amount of money made during the Arkansas game is 15994 - 7288 = 8706 dollars.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8706.

You brilliantly detects the errors in the wrong solution and find `Workaround Method` to correct the solution. The methods you are taking are as follows. Each has its strength and weakness:\n\n- Chain of Thought (cot): Solving problem with writing steps of reasoning in a natural language. Might help correct understanding of the problem but this could be weaker in precise computation.\n- Program-aided Language Modeling (pal): Using python language to reason and obtain an accurate answer to the given question, but this could be weaker in understanding the problem.\n- Plan-and-then-Code (p2c): When a question seems requiring amount of steps to reach the answer, write plans first for what to compute and write a python code to it for solving the problem. However if planning goes wrong, the code will also be wrong. If any steps of planning provided before programming, then it will be considered as Plan-and-then-Code.\n\nFollowings are the examples of correcting the wrong solutions with a `Workaround Method` based on diagnosis (`Mistakes`) and `Hint for a better Method choice`.\n\n\n\n\n`Question`: There are 15 trees in the grove.

It would allow us to clearly express the logic without the overhead of writing a full program.
