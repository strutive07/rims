At the bus stop some more children got on the bus. Then there were 10 children altogether on the bus.\nHow many more children are on the bus now than there were before the bus stop?\n\n\n(A)\nSolution:\nLet's say there were x children on the bus initially.\nThen, 2 children were already on the bus, so x = 2.\nAt the bus stop, some more children got on the bus, and now there are 10 children altogether.\nSo, the number of children who got on the bus is 10 - 2 = 8.\nSince there were 2 children initially, the total number of children who got on the bus is 8 - 2 = 6.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct.\n\n(B)\ndef solution():\n    # Initial number of children on the bus\n    initial_children = 2\n    # Final number of children on the bus\n    final_children = 10\n    # Calculate the number of children who got on the bus\n    children_got_on = final_children - initial_children\n    return children_got_on\n\n(C)\nI see what you did there! You're absolutely right. The solution is indeed to set `x` to 0, since there were no children on the bus initially. Then, the number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop is `10 - x`, which is 10. Therefore, there are 10 more children on the bus now than there were before the bus stop.\n\nHere's the Python function:\n\n\nWhich of the above three choices can correctly answer the math problem?\n"}], "meta": {"method_obj": "SimpleGreedyQueryObject", "dataset_type": "svamp", "query_kwargs": {"backbone": "Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "temperature": 0.0, "n": 1, "seed": 777, "max_tokens": 512, "stop": "\n\n\n"}, "gt_answer": 8.0}}}
