However, we only have information for two specific days: the previous day with 703 visitors and the day they visited with 246 visitors.\n\nIf we assume that the number of visitors on the day they visited (246 visitors) is representative of an average day, we can estimate the total number of visitors over 25 days by multiplying the average daily visitors by the number of days.\n\nAverage daily visitors = (Number of visitors on the previous day + Number of visitors on the day they visited) / 2\nAverage daily visitors = (703 + 246) / 2\nAverage daily visitors = 949 / 2\nAverage daily visitors = 474.5\n\nEstimated total visitors over 25 days = Average daily visitors * 25\nEstimated total visitors over 25 days = 474.5 * 25\nEstimated total visitors over 25 days = 11,862.5\n\nSince we can't have half a visitor, we can round this number to the nearest whole number, which would be 11,863 visitors.\n\nHowever, this is just an estimate based on the assumption that the number of visitors on the day they visited is an average. The actual number of visitors over 25 days could be different if the visitor numbers varied significantly from day to day.\n\n(B)\nTo solve this problem, we need to know the number of visitors for each of the 25 days, not just the previous day and the current day. However, if we assume that the number of visitors remains constant at 246 per day for the 25 days, we can calculate the total number of visitors as follows:\n\ndef solution():\n    visitors_per_day = 246\n    total_days = 25\n    # Calculate the total number of visitors over 25 days\n    total_visitors = visitors_per_day * total_days\n    return total_visitors\n\n(C)\n\n    # print(visitors_in_25_days(703, 246))\n    \n\nWhich of the above three choices can correctly answer the math problem?\n"}], "meta": {"method_obj": "SimpleGreedyQueryObject", "dataset_type": "svamp", "query_kwargs": {"backbone": "Phi-3-small-128k-instruct", "temperature": 0.0, "n": 1, "seed": 777, "max_tokens": 512, "stop": "\n\n\n"}, "gt_answer": 949.0}}}

However, we can still determine how many more baseball cards than Ace cards she has left by using the information given.\n\nLet's assume Nell gave away x baseball cards and y Ace cards to Jeff. We know that x + y = 250 (total cards given away). We also know that Nell has 309 - x baseball cards and 356 - y Ace cards left.\n\nTo find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has left, we need to subtract the number of Ace cards from the number of baseball cards: (309 - x) - (356 - y) = 309 - x - 356 + y = -47 + (x + y).\n\nSince x + y = 250, we can substitute that value into the equation: -47 + 250 = 203.\n\nSo, Nell has 203 more baseball cards than Ace cards left. However, this answer is based on the assumption that Nell gave away the same number of baseball and Ace cards to Jeff, which we don't know for sure.
