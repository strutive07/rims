She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left.\nHow many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?\n", "cot_solutions": ["Solution:\nFirst, let's find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff. We know she originally had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards, which totals 309 + 356 = 665 cards. After giving some to Jeff, she has 415 cards left. So, Nell gave away 665 - 415 = 250 cards to Jeff.\n\nNow, let's find out how many baseball and Ace cards Nell has left. We know she has 415 cards in total, but we don't have the individual counts for baseball and Ace cards after giving some to Jeff. However, we can still determine how many more baseball cards than Ace cards she has left by using the information given.\n\nLet's assume Nell gave away x baseball cards and y Ace cards to Jeff. We know that x + y = 250 (total cards given away). We also know that Nell has 309 - x baseball cards and 356 - y Ace cards left.\n\nTo find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has left, we need to subtract the number of Ace cards from the number of baseball cards: (309 - x) - (356 - y) = 309 - x - 356 + y = -47 + (x + y).\n\nSince x + y = 250, we can substitute that value into the equation: -47 + 250 = 203.\n\nSo, Nell has 203 more baseball cards than Ace cards left.

Start with the initial number of children on the bus, which is 36.\n    2. At the bus stop, 68 children got off the bus. So, the number of children on the bus after this is 36 - 68 = -32. This is not possible, so there must be a mistake in the problem statement.\n    3. However, if we assume that the problem statement meant to say that there were 12 children left on the bus after some got off and others got on, we can proceed with the calculation.\n    4. Let's denote the number of children that got on the bus as x. So, the number of children on the bus after some got off and others got on is 12.\n    5. We can set up the equation: 36 - 68 + x = 12. Solving for x, we get x = 76.\n    6. This means that 76 children got on the bus. But since the problem asks for the difference between the number of children that got off and the number that got on, we need to find out how many children got off the bus.\n    7. We know that there were 12 children left on the bus and 76 children got on the bus. So, the number of children on the bus before anyone got off is 12 - 76 = -64. This is not possible, so there must be a mistake in the problem statement.\n    8. However, if we assume that the problem statement meant to say that there were 12 children left on the bus after some got off and others got on, we can proceed with the calculation.\n    9. We know that 68 children got off the bus and there were 12 children left on the bus. So, the number of children that were on the bus before anyone got off is 12 + 68 = 80.\n    10. We also know that initially there were 36 children on the bus. So, the number of children that got on the bus is 80 - 36 = 44.\n    11. Therefore, the difference between the number of children that got off the bus and the number that got on is 68 - 44 = 24.\n    12.

Since there are now 17 roses in the vase, and Jessica added 2 roses, she must have cut 17 - 15 = 2 roses from her flower garden.\n    9.

At the bus stop 63 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 14 children altogether on the bus.\nHow many more children got on the bus than those that got off?\n\n    Let's think step by step.\n    1. Start with the initial number of children on the bus, which is 5.\n    2. Subtract the number of children that got off the bus at the bus stop, which is 63. However, since there were only 5 children on the bus to begin with, this step indicates that the number of children that got off the bus is incorrect or not possible.\n    3. If we assume that the number of children that got off the bus is a mistake and that the correct number is such that it leaves 5 children on the bus, we can calculate the number of children that got off the bus as 14 (total children on the bus after the stop) - 5 (children that remained on the bus) = 9 children.\n    4. Now, we know that 9 children got off the bus, and 63 - 9 = 54 children must have gotten on the bus to make the total 14.\n    5. To find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off, subtract the number of children that got off from the number of children that got on: 54 (children that got on) - 9 (children that got off) = 45 more children got on the bus than those that got off.\n    '''\n    initial_children = 5\n    total_children_after_stop = 14\n\n    # Step 2: Correct the number of children that got off the bus\n    children_that_got_off = total_children_after_stop - initial_children\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the number of children that got on the bus\n    children_that_got_on = 63 - children_that_got_off\n\n    # Step 5: Return the difference between the number of children that got on and off the bus\n    return children_that_got_on - children_that_got_off\n"], "cot_preds": ["9"], "pal_preds": [3.0], "p2c_preds": [45.0], "majvote_answers": [null], "need_selection": [true], "dataset_type": "svamp", "gt_answer": 9.0, "rims_selected": "p2c", "rims_solution": "def solution():\n    '''\n    Create a function solution that returns the answer of the following question: 5 children were riding on the bus.
