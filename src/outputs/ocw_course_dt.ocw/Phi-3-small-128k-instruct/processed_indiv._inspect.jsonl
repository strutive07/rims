{"question":"Subproblem 0: It has long been suspected that there is a massive black hole near the center of our Galaxy. Recently, a group of astronmers determined the parameters of a star that is orbiting the suspected black hole. The orbital period is 15 years, and the orbital radius is $0.12$ seconds of arc (as seen from the Earth). Take the distance to the Galactic center to be $8 \\mathrm{kpc}$. Compute the mass of the black hole, starting from $F=m a$. Express your answer in units of the Sun's mass; i.e., answer the question `what is the ratio of masses between this black hole and our Sun'? Give your answer to 1 significant figure. (Assume that Newton's law of gravity is applicable for orbits sufficiently far from a black hole, and that the orbiting star satisfies this condition.)\n","cot_solutions":["Solution:\nFirst, we need to convert the orbital radius from seconds of arc to astronomical units (AU). There are $206265$ arcseconds in a radian, and $1$ AU is approximately $4.848 \\times 10^{-6}$ radians. So, the orbital radius in AU is:\n\\[0.12 \\text{ arcsec} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ radian}}{206265 \\text{ arcsec}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ AU}}{4.848 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ radians}} \\approx 7.2 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ AU}\\]\n\nNext, we can use Kepler's third law to find the mass of the black hole. Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius, with the constant of proportionality being the gravitational parameter of the central body. In this case, the central body is the black hole, and the gravitational parameter is $G M$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $M$ is the mass of the black hole. So, we have:\n\\[T^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 a^3}{G M}\\]\nwhere $T$ is the orbital period and $a$ is the orbital radius. Solving for $M$, we get:\n\\[M = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 a^3}{G T^2}\\]\n\nPlugging in the values for $a$, $T$, and $G$, we get:\n\\[M = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 (7.2 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ AU})^3}{(6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}^3 \\text{ kg}^{-1} \\text{ s}^{-2})(15 \\text{ years})^2}\\]\n\\[M \\approx 4.1 \\times 10^6 \\text{ solar masses}\\]\n\nSo, the mass of the black hole is approximately $4.1 \\times 10^6$ times the mass of the Sun.

We can use the formula for the orbital speed of a star in a binary system:\n\n    $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_1 + M_2)}{r}}$\n\n    where $v$ is the orbital speed, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M_1$ and $M_2$ are the masses of the two stars, and $r$ is the orbital radius.\n\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for the total mass $M_1 + M_2$:\n\n    $M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{v^2 \\cdot r}{G}$\n\n    We know the orbital speed $v_2$ of Star 2 and its orbital radius $r_2$. We can assume that the orbital speed of Star 2 is much smaller than that of Star 1 due to its nature as an X-ray pulsar, so we can approximate $v_2$ as 0. This simplifies the formula to:\n\n    $M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{0^2 \\cdot r_2}{G} = 0$\n\n    This result is not physically meaningful, as it implies that the total mass of the system is 0. Therefore, we need more information to calculate the total mass of the system, such as the mass of Star 2 or the orbital speed of Star 1 at a different point in its orbit.\n\n    Once we have the total mass of the system, we can use Kepler's third law to find the orbital radius $r_1$ of Star 1:\n\n    $\\frac{P_{\\text{orb}}^2}{r_1^3} = \\frac{P_{\\text{orb2}}^2}{r_2^3}$\n\n    where $P_{\\text{orb2}}$ is the orbital period of Star 2.

{"question":"Subproblem 0: A Boolean function $F(A, B)$ is said to be universal if any arbitrary boolean function can be constructed by using nested $F(A, B)$ functions. A universal function is useful, since using it we can build any function we wish out of a single part. For example, when implementing boolean logic on a computer chip a universal function (called a 'gate' in logic-speak) can simplify design enormously. We would like to find a universal boolean function. In this problem we will denote the two boolean inputs $A$ and $B$ and the one boolean output as $C$. \nFirst, to help us organize our thoughts, let's enumerate all of the functions we'd like to be able to construct. How many different possible one-output boolean functions of two variables are there? I.e., how many functions are there of the form $F(A, B)=C ?$\n","cot_solutions":["Solution:\nThere are 4 possible inputs for a Boolean function with two variables: $(A, B) = (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)$. For each input, there are 2 possible outputs: $C = 0$ or $C = 1$. Therefore, there are $2^4 = 16$ possible functions of the form $F(A, B) = C$.\n\nNow, let's find a universal Boolean function. One such function is the majority function, which outputs 1 if and only if the majority of its inputs are 1. In other words, $F(A, B, C) = 1$ if at least two of $A, B, C$ are 1, and $F(A, B, C) = 0$ otherwise. This function can be used to construct any Boolean function of two variables by using nested majority functions.\n\nFor example, to construct the AND function, we can use the following nested majority function:\n\\[F(A, B) = \\text{majority}(A, \\text{majority}(B, 0), 0)\\]\nThis function outputs 1 if and only if both $A$ and $B$ are 1, which is the definition of the AND function.\n\nSimilarly, to construct the OR function, we can use the following nested majority function:\n\\[F(A, B) = \\text{majority}(0, \\text{majority}(A, B), B)\\]\nThis function outputs 1 if and only if at least one of $A$ or $B$ is 1, which is the definition of the OR function.\n\nFinally, to construct the NOT function, we can use the following nested majority function:\n\\[F(A, B) = \\text{majority}(A, B, 1)\\]\nThis function outputs 1 if and only if $A$ is 0 and $B$ is 1, or if $A$ is 1 and $B$ is 0, which is the definition of the NOT function.\n\nTherefore, the majority function is a universal Boolean function that can be used to construct any Boolean function of two variables.\n\nFinal answer: The final answer is the majority function, which can be used to construct any Boolean function of two variables."],"pal_solutions":["\nimport itertools\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef boolean_function(a, b):\n    return a and b, a or b, not a, not b, a != b, a == b, a, b\n\ndef generate_boolean_functions():\n    functions = []\n    for f in boolean_function(*itertools.product([True, False], repeat=2)):\n        functions.append(f)\n    return functions\n\nboolean_functions = generate_boolean_functions()\n# print(\"There are\", len(boolean_functions), \"possible one-output boolean functions of two variables.\")\n"],"p2c_solutions":["\n    universal_boolean_function(A, False)\n    "],"cot_preds":["the majority function, which can be used to construct any Boolean function of two variables."],"pal_preds":[null],"p2c_preds":[null],"majvote_answers":["the majority function, which can be used to construct any Boolean function of two variables."],"need_selection":[false],"dataset_type":"ocw","gt_answer":"16","answer":"16","submission":"None","cot":false,"pal":false,"p2c":false}

{"question":"Preamble: Assume that we apply a unit step in force separately to a mass \\(m\\), a dashpot \\(c\\), and a spring \\(k\\). The mass moves in inertial space. The spring and dashpot have one end connected to inertial space (reference velocity \\(=0\\) ), and the force is applied to the other end.  Assume zero initial velocity and position for the elements.\nRecall that the unit step function \\(u_{S}(t)\\) is defined as \\(u_{S}(t)=0 ; t<0\\) and \\(u_{S}(t)=1 ; t \\geq 0\\). We will also find it useful to introduce the unit impulse function \\(\\delta(t)\\) which can be defined via\n\\[\nu_{S}(t)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{t} \\delta(\\tau) d \\tau\n\\]\nThis means that we can also view the unit impulse as the derivative of the unit step:\n\\[\n\\delta(t)=\\frac{d u_{S}(t)}{d t}\n\\]\n\nSubproblem 0: Solve for the resulting velocity of the mass.\n","cot_solutions":["Solution:\nWe have a mass-spring-dashpot system with the following differential equation:\n\\[m\\ddot{x} + c\\dot{x} + kx = F(t)\\]\nwhere \\(F(t)\\) is the applied force, \\(m\\) is the mass, \\(c\\) is the damping coefficient, \\(k\\) is the spring constant, and \\(x\\) is the displacement of the mass.\n\nSince we are applying a unit step function in force separately to the mass, dashpot, and spring, we can write the force as:\n\\[F(t) = m u_{S}(t) + c \\delta(t) + k u_{S}(t)\\]\n\nNow, we need to solve the differential equation for the resulting velocity of the mass, \\(\\dot{x}(t)\\). To do this, we first find the homogeneous solution by setting \\(F(t) = 0\\):\n\\[m\\ddot{x} + c\\dot{x} + kx = 0\\]\n\nThe characteristic equation for this homogeneous differential equation is:\n\\[ms^2 + cs + k = 0\\]\n\nSolving for \\(s\\), we get the roots:\n\\[s_{1,2} = \\frac{-c \\pm \\sqrt{c^2 - 4mk}}{2m}\\]\n\nThe general solution for the homogeneous differential equation is:\n\\[x_h(t) = A e^{s_1 t} + B e^{s_2 t}\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the particular solution for the forced differential equation. Since the force is a combination of a unit step function and a unit impulse function, we can use the Laplace transform to solve the differential equation.

In our universe, the speed of light, denoted as $c$, is the ultimate speed limit, and nothing can travel faster than it. However, since this is a parallel universe, we will assume that the same principles apply.\n    \n    1. Define the problem in terms of special relativity: Manny Relativirez is running towards first base at a speed $\\beta$ relative to the baseball field. He perceives third base $45^{\\circ}$ to his left, which is an unusual observation given his direction of motion. We need to find the speed $\\beta$ in terms of the speed of light $c$.\n    \n    2. Use the concept of relativistic aberration: Relativistic aberration is the phenomenon where the apparent direction of an object changes due to the relative motion between the observer and the object. In this case, Manny's perception of third base changes due to his motion towards first base. The formula for relativistic aberration is given by:\n    \n       \\[\n       \\cos \\theta' = \\frac{\\cos \\theta - \\frac{v}{c}}{1 - \\frac{v}{c} \\cos \\theta}\n       \\]\n    \n       where $\\theta'$ is the apparent angle (in this case, $45^{\\circ}$), $\\theta$ is the actual angle (in this case, $90^{\\circ}$, since third base is to his left), $v$ is Manny's speed relative to the baseball field, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    \n    3. Solve for Manny's speed $\\beta$ in terms of $c$: We can rearrange the relativistic aberration formula to solve for $v$ (Manny's speed $\\beta$):\n    \n       \\[\n       v = c \\left( \\frac{\\cos \\theta - \\cos \\theta'}{\\cos \\theta' + \\frac{\\cos \\theta}{c}} \\right)\n       \\]\n    \n       Plugging in the values for $\\theta$ and $\\theta'$, we get:\n    \n       \\[\n       v = c \\left( \\frac{\\cos 90^{\\circ} - \\cos 45^{\\circ}}{\\cos 45^{\\circ} + \\frac{\\cos 90^{\\circ}}{c}} \\right)\n       \\]\n    \n       Simplifying, we find:\n    \n       \\[\n       v = c \\left( \\frac{0 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + 0} \\right) = -\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{2}}\n       \\]\n    \n       Since speed cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n    \n       \\[\n       \\beta = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{2}}\n       \\]\n    \n       Therefore, Manny Relativirez is running at a speed of $\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{2}}$ towards first base, as perceived from his unusual observation of third base $45^{\\circ}$ to his left.\n    '''\n    return \"Manny Relativirez is running at a speed of $\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{2}}$ towards first base, as perceived from his unusual observation of third base $45^{\\circ}$ to his left.\""],"cot_preds":["$0.707c$"],"pal_preds":["sqrt(2)*beta\/c"],"p2c_preds":["Manny Relativirez is running at a speed of $\frac{c}{\\sqrt{2}}$ towards first base, as perceived from his unusual observation of third base $45^{\\circ}$ to his left."],"majvote_answers":[null],"need_selection":[true],"dataset_type":"ocw","gt_answer":"\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}c","answer":"\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}c","submission":"Manny Relativirez is running at a speed of $\frac{c}{\\sqrt{2}}$ towards first base, as perceived from his unusual observation of third base $45^{\\circ}$ to his left.","cot":false,"pal":false,"p2c":false}

What wavelength does Manny see in terms of $\\lambda_{\\text {red}}}$?\n\n    Let's think step by step.\n    To solve Subproblem 1, we will use the relativistic Doppler effect formula for light. The formula for the observed wavelength $\\lambda'$ when the source is moving away from the observer is given by:\n    \n    $$\\lambda' = \\lambda \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\beta}{1 - \\beta}}$$\n    \n    where $\\lambda$ is the emitted wavelength, $\\beta$ is the velocity of the source as a fraction of the speed of light $c$, and $\\theta'$ is the angle at which the source is observed relative to the direction of motion.\n    \n    Given that Manny sees third base $45^{\\circ}$ to his left, we can use the aberration formula to find $\\beta$:\n    \n    $$\\cos \\theta' = \\frac{\\cos \\theta - \\beta}{1 - \\beta \\cos \\theta}$$\n    \n    where $\\theta$ is the angle the source would be observed if the source were at rest relative to the observer (in this case, $45^{\\circ}$ to the left, or $135^{\\circ}$ from the forward direction). Since Manny is very close to home plate, we can assume that the angle $\\theta$ is approximately $90^{\\circ}$ (straight to the left). Plugging in the values, we get:\n    \n    $$\\cos 45^{\\circ} = \\frac{\\cos 90^{\\circ} - \\beta}{1 - \\beta \\cos 90^{\\circ}}$$\n    $$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{0 - \\beta}{1 - 0}$$\n    $$\\beta = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\n    \n    Since $\\beta$ is negative, it means that Manny is moving towards third base. However, we are interested in the wavelength he sees, so we will use the positive value of $\\beta$ (since the Doppler effect formula only works for positive velocities). Thus, $\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n    \n    Now, we can plug this value of $\\beta$ into the relativistic Doppler effect formula to find the observed wavelength $\\lambda'$:\n    \n    $$\\lambda' = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}{1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}}$$\n    $$\\lambda' = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{2} + 1}{\\sqrt{2} - 1}}$$\n    \n    This is the wavelength that Manny sees in terms of $\\lambda_{\\text{red}}}$.\n    '''\n    # Step 1: Define the aberration formula\n    def aberration_formula(theta, beta):\n        cos_theta_prime = (cos(theta) - beta) \/ (1 - beta * cos(theta))\n        return cos_theta_prime\n\n    # Step 2: Define the relativistic Doppler effect formula\n    def doppler_effect_formula(lambda_red, beta):\n        return lambda_red * ((1 + beta) \/ (1 - beta)) ** 0.5\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the velocity of Manny\n    theta_prime = pi \/ 4  # 45 degrees to the left\n    theta = pi \/ 2  # Straight to the left\n    beta = 1 \/ sqrt(2)\n    v = beta * c  # Manny's velocity in terms of the speed of light\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the wavelength Manny sees\n    lambda_prime = doppler_effect_formula(lambda_red, beta)\n\n    return v, lambda_prime  # Manny's velocity"],"cot_preds":["$\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text {red}}}}{\\sqrt{3}}$"],"pal_preds":["I\/c*c"],"p2c_preds":[null],"majvote_answers":[null],"need_selection":[true],"dataset_type":"ocw","gt_answer":"\\lambda_{\\text {red}} \/ \\sqrt{2}","answer":"\\lambda_{\\text {red}} \/ \\sqrt{2}","submission":"None","cot":false,"pal":false,"p2c":false}

The kinetic energy of the electron is given by:\n\n    E_kinetic = 1\/2 mv^2\n\n    where m is the mass of the electron (9.109\u00d710^-31 kg) and v is the velocity of the electron.\n\n    Since the energy of the photon is completely transferred to the electron, we can equate the two energies:\n\n    hc\/\u03bb = 1\/2 mv^2\n\n    Now we can solve for the velocity v of the electron:\n\n    v = sqrt(2hc\/\u03bbm)\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n\n    v = sqrt(2 * 6.626 * 10^-34 * 3 * 10^8 \/ (4.28 * 10^-7 * 9.109 * 10^-31))\n\n    v = sqrt(2 * 6.626 * 3 \/ (4.28 * 9.109) * 10^(-34 + 8 + 2 * 7 - 2 * 31))\n\n    v = sqrt(39.756 \/ 39.073 * 10^(-34 + 8 - 62))\n\n    v = sqrt(1.018 * 10^5)\n\n    v = 319.67 * 10^2 m\/s\n\n    So the velocity of the electron after interaction is approximately 3.20\u00d710^5 m\/s.\n    '''\n    return 3.20 * 10**5"],"cot_preds":["$3.37 \\times 10^6 {~m\/s}$"],"pal_preds":[null],"p2c_preds":[320000.0],"majvote_answers":[null],"need_selection":[true],"dataset_type":"ocw","gt_answer":"2.19e6","answer":"2.19e6","submission":"320000.0","cot":false,"pal":false,"p2c":false}

Experimentally, the decay rate can be measured to $\\pm 0.1$ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon. The half-life of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ is 5730 years.\n\nSubproblem 0: What is the maximum age of a sample that can be dated, in years?\n","cot_solutions":["Solution:\nThe decay rate of a radioactive isotope is related to its half-life by the formula:\n\\[ \\text{decay rate} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\text{half-life}} \\]\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the half-life:\n\\[ \\text{half-life} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\text{decay rate}} \\]\nThe maximum age of a sample that can be dated is the time it takes for the decay rate to be equal to the experimental uncertainty. In other words, we want to find the time it takes for the decay rate to decrease from 15.3 disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon to 15.2 disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon. We can use the decay rate formula to find this time:\n\\[ 15.2 = 15.3 e^{-\\lambda t} \\]\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the decay constant and $t$ is the time in years. We can solve for $t$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\\[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{15.2}{15.3}\\right) = -\\lambda t \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{15.3}{15.2}\\right)}{\\lambda} \\]\nWe can find the decay constant by using the half-life formula:\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\text{half-life}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{5730} \\]\nPlugging this value into the equation for $t$, we get:\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{15.3}{15.2}\\right)}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{5730}} \\]\n\\[ t \\approx 0.5 \\text{ years} \\]\nThis means that the maximum age of a sample that can be dated is approximately 0.5 years. However, this is not a very useful result, since we can date samples that are much older than this. To find the maximum useful age of a sample, we need to consider the fact that the decay rate decreases exponentially with time. This means that the longer a sample has been decaying, the smaller the difference between its decay rate and the decay rate of a living sample will be. We can use the following formula to estimate the maximum useful age of a sample:\n\\[ t_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\text{decay rate of living sample}}{\\text{experimental uncertainty}}\\right)}{\\lambda} \\]\nPlugging in the values given in the problem, we get:\n\\[ t_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{15.3}{0.1}\\right)}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{5730}} \\]\n\\[ t_{\\text{max}} \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ years} \\]\nThis means that the maximum useful age of a sample that can be dated using ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ is approximately 150,000 years.\nFinal answer: The final answer is 150000.

It crystallizes in a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure. To find the highest linear density of atoms, we need to calculate the number of atoms per unit length along the cube's edge.\n\nIn a BCC structure, there is one atom at each corner of the cube and one atom at the center. Each corner atom is shared by eight adjacent cubes, so each corner contributes 1\/8 of an atom to the current cube. Since there are eight corners, the total contribution from corner atoms is 1 atom. The center atom is not shared, so it contributes 1 atom. Therefore, there are 2 atoms per BCC unit cell.\n\nThe edge length of the BCC unit cell (a) can be calculated using the atomic radius (r) and the relationship between the atomic radius and the edge length in a BCC structure: $a = 4r\/\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe linear density of atoms (LD) is the number of atoms per unit length along the cube's edge: $LD = 2\/a$.\n\nTo find the atomic radius, we can use the atomic packing factor (APF) for a BCC structure, which is approximately 0.68. The APF is the ratio of the volume occupied by atoms in a unit cell to the total volume of the unit cell. For a BCC structure, the APF is given by: $APF = \\frac{2 \\times \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3}{a^3}$.\n\nSolving for the atomic radius (r) in terms of the edge length (a) and the APF, we get: $r = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{0.68 \\times a^3}{8}}$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for the atomic radius (r) in terms of the edge length (a) into the relationship between the atomic radius and the edge length in a BCC structure, we get: $a = 4 \\times \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{0.68 \\times a^3}{8}}\/\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nSolving for the edge length (a), we get: $a \\approx 2.87 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n\nSubstituting the value of the edge length (a) into the expression for the linear density of atoms (LD), we get: $LD = 2\/(2.87 \\times 10^{-10}) \\approx \\boxed{6.94 \\times 10^{9}}$ atoms\/m.\n\nFinal answer: The highest linear density of atoms encountered in vanadium (V) is approximately $6.94 \\times 10^{9}$ atoms\/m."],"pal_solutions":["import sympy as sp\n\ndef vanadium_atom_density():\n    # Vanadium has an atomic mass of 50.9415 g\/mol and a density of 6.0 g\/cm^3\n    atomic_mass = 50.9415  # in g\/mol\n    density = 6.0  # in g\/cm^3\n\n    # Avogadro's number (number of atoms in one mole)\n    avogadro_number = 6.02214076e23  # in atoms\/mol\n\n    # Convert density from g\/cm^3 to kg\/m^3\n    density_kg_per_m3 = density * 1e3\n\n    # Calculate the number of moles in 1 m^3 of vanadium\n    moles_per_m3 = density_kg_per_m3 \/ atomic_mass\n\n    # Calculate the number of atoms in 1 m^3 of vanadium\n    atoms_per_m3 = moles_per_m3 * avogadro_number\n\n    # Vanadium has a body-centered cubic (bcc) structure, so there are 2 atoms per unit cell\n    atoms_per_unit_cell = 2\n\n    # Calculate the edge length of the unit cell (a) in meters\n    a = sp.sqrt(3) \/ sp.sqrt(2)  # in cm, the cube root of the density gives the edge length for bcc\n    a_m = a \/ 1e2\n\n    # Calculate the linear density of atoms (atoms\/m)\n    linear_density = atoms_per_unit_cell \/ a_m\n\n    # Format the answer as n * 10^x\n    linear_density_formatted = f\"{linear_density.evalf():.2f} * 10^{int(sp.log10(linear_density.evalf())))}\"\n\n    return linear_density_formatted\n\n# Example usage\n# print(vanadium_atom_density())"],"p2c_solutions":["def solution():\n    '''\n    Create a function solution that returns the answer of the following question: Subproblem 0: Determine the highest linear density of atoms (atoms\/m) encountered in vanadium (V).
