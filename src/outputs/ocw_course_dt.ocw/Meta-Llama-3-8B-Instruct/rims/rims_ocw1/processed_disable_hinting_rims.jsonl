The customers arrive at the rate of one per second. One of the chefs says that this system will never work because customers can only send one bit per second, the rate at which orders can be accepted, so you could barely keep up even if there were no noise in the channel. You are hired as an outside consultant to deal with the problem.\nWhat is the channel capacity $\\mathrm{C}$ of this communication channel in bits per second?\n", "cot_solutions": ["Solution:\nThe channel capacity is the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted reliably over the channel. In this case, the channel is the communication between the customer and the cook.\n\nThe customer can send one of two messages: \"B\" or \"Z\". This is equivalent to sending one bit of information per second.\n\nHowever, the cooks misinterpret the message 8% of the time, which means that the effective transmission rate is reduced. To calculate the effective transmission rate, we can use the formula:\n\nEffective transmission rate = (1 - error rate) x transmission rate\n\nIn this case, the error rate is 8%, so:\n\nEffective transmission rate = (1 - 0.08) x 1 bit/s = 0.92 bits/s\n\nTherefore, the channel capacity C is 0.92 bits per second.\n\nFinal answer: The final answer is 0.92 bits per second.
