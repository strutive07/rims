Let's call this distance $d$. Since he sees third base $45^{\\circ}$ to his left, this means that the angle between his direction of motion and the direction to third base is $45^{\\circ}$.\n\nUsing the concept of relativistic velocity addition, we can write:\n\nβ = γ (v + v') = γ (v + v' / γ)\n\nwhere v' is the velocity of the third base relative to Manny, v is the velocity of Manny relative to the home plate, and γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nSince v' is perpendicular to v, we can write:\n\nv' = v tan(45^{\\circ}) = v / √2\n\nSubstituting this into the equation above, we get:\n\nβ = γ (v + v / γ√2)\n\nSimplifying and rearranging, we get:\n\nβ = v / √2 + v / γ\n\nSince v is very small compared to c, we can approximate γ as 1. Therefore:\n\nβ ≈ v / √2 + v\n\nSince v is the speed of light, we can substitute c for v:\n\nβ ≈ c / √2 + c\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nβ ≈ 1.414c\n\nSo, Manny is running at approximately 1.414 times the speed of light.\n\nFinal answer: The final answer is 1.414c.
