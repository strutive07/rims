The side chain (guanidinium group, -C(NH2)2+), which has a pKa of approximately 12.48.\n\nAt a pH of 1.0, all three groups are in their protonated forms due to the low pH value being well below their respective pKa values. The carboxyl group would be COOH, the amino group would be NH3+, and the side chain would be protonated as well. The net charge of arginine in this situation is the sum of the charges of these groups:\n\n- The carboxyl group (-COOH) is neutral at this pH.\n- The amino group (-NH3+) carries a charge of +1.\n- The guanidinium group (-C(NH2)2+) carries a charge of +1.\n\nNet charge = 0 (from -COOH) +1 (from -NH3+) +1 (from -C(NH2)2+)\n\nNet charge = +2\n\nThus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +2.\n\nFinal answer: The net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +2.\n`Answer 2`: $2$\n`Evaluation`: Correct\n\n\n\n`Question`:\nProblem:\nSubproblem 0: Let $z = 1 + \\sqrt{3} i$.

Carboxyl group will not have a positive charge; protonation of the carboxyl group actually neutralizes its charge. Additionally, the guanidinium group already has a positive charge at neutral pH, and this charge does not change at pH 1.0. The amino group does carry a positive charge at low pH.\n`Workaround Method`: Chain of Thought (cot)\n`Attempt 2`:\nArginine is an amino acid with three groups that can be protonated and contribute to its net charge, depending on the solution's pH:\n\n1. The carboxyl group (-COOH), which typically has a pKa around 2.17.\n2. The amino group (-NH3+), with a pKa around 9.04.\n3. The side chain (guanidinium group, -C(NH2)2+), which has a pKa of approximately 12.48.\n\nAt a pH of 1.0, all three groups are in their protonated forms due to the low pH value being well below their respective pKa values. The carboxyl group would be COOH, the amino group would be NH3+, and the side chain would be protonated as well. The net charge of arginine in this situation is the sum of the charges of these groups:\n\n- The carboxyl group (-COOH) is neutral at this pH.\n- The amino group (-NH3+) carries a charge of +1.\n- The guanidinium group (-C(NH2)2+) carries a charge of +1.\n\nNet charge = 0 (from -COOH) +1 (from -NH3+) +1 (from -C(NH2)2+)\n\nNet charge = +2\n\nThus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +2.\n\nFinal answer: The net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +2.\n`Answer 2`: $2$\n`Evaluation`: Correct\n\n\n\n`Question`:\nProblem:\nSubproblem 0: Let $z = 1 + \\sqrt{3} i$.

The side chain (guanidinium group, -C(NH2)2+), which has a pKa of approximately 12.48.\n\nAt a pH of 1.0, all three groups are in their protonated forms due to the low pH value being well below their respective pKa values. The carboxyl group would be COOH, the amino group would be NH3+, and the side chain would be protonated as well. The net charge of arginine in this situation is the sum of the charges of these groups:\n\n- The carboxyl group (-COOH) is neutral at this pH.\n- The amino group (-NH3+) carries a charge of +1.\n- The guanidinium group (-C(NH2)2+) carries a charge of +1.\n\nNet charge = 0 (from -COOH) +1 (from -NH3+) +1 (from -C(NH2)2+)\n\nNet charge = +2\n\nThus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +2.\n\nFinal answer: The net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +2.\n`Answer 2`: $2$\n`Evaluation`: Correct\n\n\n\n`Question`:\nProblem:\nSubproblem 0: Let $z = 1 + \\sqrt{3} i$.

Carboxyl group will not have a positive charge; protonation of the carboxyl group actually neutralizes its charge. Additionally, the guanidinium group already has a positive charge at neutral pH, and this charge does not change at pH 1.0. The amino group does carry a positive charge at low pH.\n`Workaround Method`: Chain of Thought (cot)\n`Attempt 2`:\nArginine is an amino acid with three groups that can be protonated and contribute to its net charge, depending on the solution's pH:\n\n1. The carboxyl group (-COOH), which typically has a pKa around 2.17.\n2. The amino group (-NH3+), with a pKa around 9.04.\n3. The side chain (guanidinium group, -C(NH2)2+), which has a pKa of approximately 12.48.\n\nAt a pH of 1.0, all three groups are in their protonated forms due to the low pH value being well below their respective pKa values. The carboxyl group would be COOH, the amino group would be NH3+, and the side chain would be protonated as well. The net charge of arginine in this situation is the sum of the charges of these groups:\n\n- The carboxyl group (-COOH) is neutral at this pH.\n- The amino group (-NH3+) carries a charge of +1.\n- The guanidinium group (-C(NH2)2+) carries a charge of +1.\n\nNet charge = 0 (from -COOH) +1 (from -NH3+) +1 (from -C(NH2)2+)\n\nNet charge = +2\n\nThus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +2.\n\nFinal answer: The net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +2.\n`Answer 2`: $2$\n`Evaluation`: Correct\n\n\n\n`Question`:\nProblem:\nSubproblem 0: Let $z = 1 + \\sqrt{3} i$.

At 800°C, there is one vacancy for every 10,000 atoms. This means that the energy required to create a vacancy is equal to the energy required to heat 10,000 atoms from 0°C to 800°C.\n\nWe can use this information to find the temperature at which there is one vacancy for every 1,000 atoms.\n\nLet's denote the temperature we are looking for as T. The energy required to create a vacancy is equal to the energy required to heat 1,000 atoms from 0°C to T.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n2.0 eV = 1,000 * (T - 0°C)\n\nSolving for T, we get:\n\nT = 2.0 eV / 1,000 + 0°C\n\nT = 0.002 eV/atom + 0°C\n\nTo convert this to Celsius, we use the conversion factor that 1 eV/atom is approximately equal to 11,604.5 K.\n\nT = 0.002 eV/atom * 11,604.5 K/eV/atom + 0°C\n\nT = 23.209 K + 0°C\n\nSince the question asks for the answer in Celsius, we convert Kelvin to Celsius by subtracting 273.15.\n\nT = 23.209 K - 273.15 K\n\nT = -249.941 K\n\nHowever, this temperature is below 0°C, which is not possible in this context.

The side chain (guanidinium group, -C(NH2)2+), which has a pKa of approximately 12.48.\n\nAt a pH of 1.0, all three groups are in their protonated forms due to the low pH value being well below their respective pKa values. The carboxyl group would be COOH, the amino group would be NH3+, and the side chain would be protonated as well. The net charge of arginine in this situation is the sum of the charges of these groups:\n\n- The carboxyl group (-COOH) is neutral at this pH.\n- The amino group (-NH3+) carries a charge of +1.\n- The guanidinium group (-C(NH2)2+) carries a charge of +1.\n\nNet charge = 0 (from -COOH) +1 (from -NH3+) +1 (from -C(NH2)2+)\n\nNet charge = +2\n\nThus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +2.\n\nFinal answer: The net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +2.\n`Answer 2`: $2$\n`Evaluation`: Correct\n\n\n\n`Question`:\nProblem:\nSubproblem 0: Let $z = 1 + \\sqrt{3} i$.

Carboxyl group will not have a positive charge; protonation of the carboxyl group actually neutralizes its charge.

The amino group does carry a positive charge at low pH.\n`Workaround Method`: Chain of Thought (cot)\n`Attempt 2`:\nArginine is an amino acid with three groups that can be protonated and contribute to its net charge, depending on the solution's pH:\n\n1. The carboxyl group (-COOH), which typically has a pKa around 2.17.\n2. The amino group (-NH3+), with a pKa around 9.04.\n3. The side chain (guanidinium group, -C(NH2)2+), which has a pKa of approximately 12.48.\n\nAt a pH of 1.0, all three groups are in their protonated forms due to the low pH value being well below their respective pKa values. The carboxyl group would be COOH, the amino group would be NH3+, and the side chain would be protonated as well. The net charge of arginine in this situation is the sum of the charges of these groups:\n\n- The carboxyl group (-COOH) is neutral at this pH.\n- The amino group (-NH3+) carries a charge of +1.\n- The guanidinium group (-C(NH2)2+) carries a charge of +1.\n\nNet charge = 0 (from -COOH) +1 (from -NH3+) +1 (from -C(NH2)2+)\n\nNet charge = +2\n\nThus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +2.\n\nFinal answer: The net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +2.\n`Answer 2`: $2$\n`Evaluation`: Correct\n\n\n\n`Question`:\nProblem:\nSubproblem 0: Let $z = 1 + \\sqrt{3} i$.

The side chain (guanidinium group, -C(NH2)2+), which has a pKa of approximately 12.48.\n\nAt a pH of 1.0, all three groups are in their protonated forms due to the low pH value being well below their respective pKa values. The carboxyl group would be COOH, the amino group would be NH3+, and the side chain would be protonated as well. The net charge of arginine in this situation is the sum of the charges of these groups:\n\n- The carboxyl group (-COOH) is neutral at this pH.\n- The amino group (-NH3+) carries a charge of +1.\n- The guanidinium group (-C(NH2)2+) carries a charge of +1.\n\nNet charge = 0 (from -COOH) +1 (from -NH3+) +1 (from -C(NH2)2+)\n\nNet charge = +2\n\nThus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +2.\n\nFinal answer: The net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +2.\n`Answer 2`: $2$\n`Evaluation`: Correct\n\n\n\n`Question`:\nProblem:\nSubproblem 0: Let $z = 1 + \\sqrt{3} i$.

The carboxyl group (-COOH), which typically has a pKa around 2.17.\n2. The amino group (-NH3+), with a pKa around 9.04.\n3. The side chain (guanidinium group, -C(NH2)2+), which has a pKa of approximately 12.48.\n\nAt a pH of 1.0, all three groups are in their protonated forms due to the low pH value being well below their respective pKa values. The carboxyl group would be COOH, the amino group would be NH3+, and the side chain would be protonated as well. The net charge of arginine in this situation is the sum of the charges of these groups:\n\n- The carboxyl group (-COOH) is neutral at this pH.\n- The amino group (-NH3+) carries a charge of +1.\n- The guanidinium group (-C(NH2)2+) carries a charge of +1.\n\nNet charge = 0 (from -COOH) +1 (from -NH3+) +1 (from -C(NH2)2+)\n\nNet charge = +2\n\nThus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +2.\n\nFinal answer: The net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +2.\n`Answer 2`: $2$\n`Evaluation`: Correct\n\n\n\n`Question`:\nProblem:\nSubproblem 0: Let $z = 1 + \\sqrt{3} i$.
