To find the linear density of atoms in vanadium, we need to calculate the volume of one atom and then divide the number of atoms in one mole by this volume.\n\n The volume of one atom can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\n \\[ V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\]\n\n where \\( r \\) is the atomic radius. Substituting the atomic radius of vanadium, we get:\n\n \\[ V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (0.1355 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m})^3 \\]\n\n \\[ V \\approx 1.09 \\times 10^{-29} \\text{ m}^3 \\]\n\n The number of atoms in one mole of vanadium can be calculated using Avogadro's constant and the molar mass of vanadium:\n\n \\[ N = \\frac{N_A}{M} \\]\n\n where \\( N_A \\) is Avogadro's constant (\\( 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ atoms/mol} \\)) and \\( M \\) is the molar mass of vanadium (\\( 50.9415 \\text{ g/mol} \\)). Substituting these values, we get:\n\n \\[ N \\approx 1.18 \\times 10^{25} \\text{ atoms/mol} \\]\n\n The linear density of atoms in vanadium is then:\n\n \\[ \\rho = \\frac{N}{V} \\]\n\n \\[ \\rho \\approx \\frac{1.18 \\times 10^{25} \\text{ atoms/mol}}{1.09 \\times 10^{-29} \\text{ m}^3} \\]\n\n \\[ \\rho \\approx 1.09 \\times 10^{34} \\text{ atoms/m} \\]\n\n However, this value is too large to be reasonable for a linear density. The mistake in the calculation is that the volume of one atom was not correctly calculated. The correct calculation should be:\n\n \\[ V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (0.1355 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m})^3 \\]\n\n \\[ V \\approx 1.09 \\times 10^{-29} \\text{ m}^3 \\]\n\n The linear density of atoms in vanadium is then:\n\n \\[ \\rho = \\frac{N}{V} \\]\n\n \\[ \\rho \\approx \\frac{1.18 \\times 10^{25} \\text{ atoms/mol}}{1.09 \\times 10^{-29} \\text{ m}^3} \\]\n\n \\[ \\rho \\approx 1.09 \\times 10^{34} \\text{ atoms/m} \\]\n\n This value is still too large, indicating that the calculation of the number of atoms in one mole was incorrect.
