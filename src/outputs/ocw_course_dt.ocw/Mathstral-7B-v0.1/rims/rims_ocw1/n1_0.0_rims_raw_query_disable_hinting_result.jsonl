You brilliantly detects the errors in the wrong solution and find `Workaround Method` to correct the solution. The methods you are taking are as follows. Each has its strength and weakness:\n\n- Chain of Thought (cot): Solving problem with writing steps of reasoning in a natural language. Might help correct understanding of the problem but this could be weaker in precise computation.\n- Program-aided Language Modeling (pal): Using python language to reason and obtain an accurate answer to the given question, but this could be weaker in understanding the problem.\n- Plan-and-then-Code (p2c): When a question seems requiring amount of steps to reach the answer, write plans first for what to compute and write a python code to it for solving the problem. However if planning goes wrong, the code will also be wrong. If any steps of planning provided before programming, then it will be considered as Plan-and-then-Code.\n\nFollowings are the examples of correcting the wrong solutions with a `Workaround Method` based on diagnosis (`Mistakes`).\n\n\n\n\n`Question`:\nProblem:\nSubproblem 0: What is the net charge of arginine in a solution of $\\mathrm{pH} 1.0$?\nPlease format your answer as +n or -n.\n`Method`: Plan-and-then-Code (p2c)\n`Attempt 1`:\ndef solution():\n    # pKa values for arginine\n    pKa_carboxyl = 3.0\n    pKa_amino = 8.0\n    pKa_guanidinium = 11.0\n\n    # pH value for the solution\n    pH = 1.0\n\n    # Determine the charge state of each group at pH 1.0\n    charge_carboxyl = 1 if pH > pKa_carboxyl else 0\n    charge_amino = -1 if pH > pKa_amino else 0\n    charge_guanidinium = -1 if pH > pKa_guanidinium else 0\n\n    # Calculate the net charge\n    net_charge = charge_carboxyl - charge_amino - charge_guanidinium\n\n    # Format the net charge\n    formatted_charge = f\"+{net_charge}\" if net_charge >= 0 else f\"{net_charge}\"\n    return formatted_charge\n`Answer 1`: +0\n`Evaluation`: Wrong\n`Mistakes`: The attempt above wrongly calculates the net charge and also uses wrong charges for functional groups. Carboxyl group will not have a positive charge; protonation of the carboxyl group actually neutralizes its charge. Additionally, the guanidinium group already has a positive charge at neutral pH, and this charge does not change at pH 1.0. The amino group does carry a positive charge at low pH.\n`Workaround Method`: Chain of Thought (cot)\n`Attempt 2`:\nArginine is an amino acid with three groups that can be protonated and contribute to its net charge, depending on the solution's pH:\n\n1. The carboxyl group (-COOH), which typically has a pKa around 2.17.\n2. The amino group (-NH3+), with a pKa around 9.04.\n3. The side chain (guanidinium group, -C(NH2)2+), which has a pKa of approximately 12.48.\n\nAt a pH of 1.0, all three groups are in their protonated forms due to the low pH value being well below their respective pKa values. The carboxyl group would be COOH, the amino group would be NH3+, and the side chain would be protonated as well. The net charge of arginine in this situation is the sum of the charges of these groups:\n\n- The carboxyl group (-COOH) is neutral at this pH.\n- The amino group (-NH3+) carries a charge of +1.\n- The guanidinium group (-C(NH2)2+) carries a charge of +1.\n\nNet charge = 0 (from -COOH) +1 (from -NH3+) +1 (from -C(NH2)2+)\n\nNet charge = +2\n\nThus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +2.\n\nFinal answer: The net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +2.\n`Answer 2`: $2$\n`Evaluation`: Correct\n\n\n\n`Question`:\nProblem:\nSubproblem 0: Let $z = 1 + \\sqrt{3} i$.

In a BCC crystal, the shortest side of the unit cell is the body diagonal.\n\nThe length of the body diagonal (d) in a BCC crystal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nd = a√3\n\nwhere a is the lattice parameter (the length of one side of the unit cell).\n\nThe lattice parameter of vanadium is approximately 3.04 angstroms.

However if planning goes wrong, the code will also be wrong. If any steps of planning provided before programming, then it will be considered as Plan-and-then-Code.\n\nFollowings are the examples of correcting the wrong solutions with a `Workaround Method` based on diagnosis (`Mistakes`).\n\n\n\n\n`Question`:\nProblem:\nSubproblem 0: What is the net charge of arginine in a solution of $\\mathrm{pH} 1.0$?\nPlease format your answer as +n or -n.\n`Method`: Plan-and-then-Code (p2c)\n`Attempt 1`:\ndef solution():\n    # pKa values for arginine\n    pKa_carboxyl = 3.0\n    pKa_amino = 8.0\n    pKa_guanidinium = 11.0\n\n    # pH value for the solution\n    pH = 1.0\n\n    # Determine the charge state of each group at pH 1.0\n    charge_carboxyl = 1 if pH > pKa_carboxyl else 0\n    charge_amino = -1 if pH > pKa_amino else 0\n    charge_guanidinium = -1 if pH > pKa_guanidinium else 0\n\n    # Calculate the net charge\n    net_charge = charge_carboxyl - charge_amino - charge_guanidinium\n\n    # Format the net charge\n    formatted_charge = f\"+{net_charge}\" if net_charge >= 0 else f\"{net_charge}\"\n    return formatted_charge\n`Answer 1`: +0\n`Evaluation`: Wrong\n`Mistakes`: The attempt above wrongly calculates the net charge and also uses wrong charges for functional groups. Carboxyl group will not have a positive charge; protonation of the carboxyl group actually neutralizes its charge. Additionally, the guanidinium group already has a positive charge at neutral pH, and this charge does not change at pH 1.0. The amino group does carry a positive charge at low pH.\n`Workaround Method`: Chain of Thought (cot)\n`Attempt 2`:\nArginine is an amino acid with three groups that can be protonated and contribute to its net charge, depending on the solution's pH:\n\n1. The carboxyl group (-COOH), which typically has a pKa around 2.17.\n2. The amino group (-NH3+), with a pKa around 9.04.\n3. The side chain (guanidinium group, -C(NH2)2+), which has a pKa of approximately 12.48.\n\nAt a pH of 1.0, all three groups are in their protonated forms due to the low pH value being well below their respective pKa values. The carboxyl group would be COOH, the amino group would be NH3+, and the side chain would be protonated as well. The net charge of arginine in this situation is the sum of the charges of these groups:\n\n- The carboxyl group (-COOH) is neutral at this pH.\n- The amino group (-NH3+) carries a charge of +1.\n- The guanidinium group (-C(NH2)2+) carries a charge of +1.\n\nNet charge = 0 (from -COOH) +1 (from -NH3+) +1 (from -C(NH2)2+)\n\nNet charge = +2\n\nThus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +2.\n\nFinal answer: The net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +2.\n`Answer 2`: $2$\n`Evaluation`: Correct\n\n\n\n`Question`:\nProblem:\nSubproblem 0: Let $z = 1 + \\sqrt{3} i$.
