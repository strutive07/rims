The side chain (guanidinium group, -C(NH2)2+), which has a pKa of approximately 12.48.\n\nAt a pH of 1.0, all three groups are in their protonated forms due to the low pH value being well below their respective pKa values. The carboxyl group would be COOH, the amino group would be NH3+, and the side chain would be protonated as well. The net charge of arginine in this situation is the sum of the charges of these groups:\n\n- The carboxyl group (-COOH) is neutral at this pH.\n- The amino group (-NH3+) carries a charge of +1.\n- The guanidinium group (-C(NH2)2+) carries a charge of +1.\n\nNet charge = 0 (from -COOH) +1 (from -NH3+) +1 (from -C(NH2)2+)\n\nNet charge = +2\n\nThus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +2.\n\nFinal answer: The net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +2.\n`Answer 2`: $2$\n`Evaluation`: Correct\n\n\n\n`Question`:\nProblem:\nSubproblem 0: Let $z = 1 + \\sqrt{3} i$.

The characteristic equation is $s^2 - 1 = 0$, which has roots $s = \\pm 1$. Therefore, the general solution of the homogeneous equation is $x_h(t) = Ae^t + Be^{-t}$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants.\n\nNext, we need to find a particular solution $x_p(t)$ of the non-homogeneous equation. Since the right-hand side of the equation is a polynomial of degree 2, we can assume that $x_p(t)$ is also a polynomial of degree 2, i.e., $x_p(t) = At^2 + Bt + C$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constants.\n\nSubstituting $x_p(t)$ into the differential equation, we get:\n\n$\\ddot{x_p} - x_p = 2At + B - (At^2 + Bt + C) = t^2 + t + 1$\n\nEquating coefficients of like terms, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$\\begin{cases} 2A = 1 \\\\\\\\ B - A = 1 \\\\\\\\ -A = 1 \\end{cases}$\n\nSolving this system, we get $A = -\\frac{1}{2}$, $B = \\frac{1}{2}$, and $C = 0$. Therefore, the particular solution is $x_p(t) = -\\frac{1}{2}t^2 + \\frac{1}{2}t$.\n\nThe general solution of the differential equation is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions, i.e., $x(t) = x_h(t) + x_p(t) = Ae^t + Be^{-t} - \\frac{1}{2}t^2 + \\frac{1}{2}t$.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial solution of the differential equation $\\ddot{x}-x=t^{2}+t+1$ is $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}t^2 + \\frac{1}{2}t}$.\n`Answer 1`: $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}t^2 + \\frac{1}{2}t}$"], "query_message": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are now solving math/science problems.

Might help correct understanding of the problem but this could be weaker in precise computation.\n- Program-aided Language Modeling (pal): Using python language to reason and obtain an accurate answer to the given question, but this could be weaker in understanding the problem.\n- Plan-and-then-Code (p2c): When a question seems requiring amount of steps to reach the answer, write plans first for what to compute and write a python code to it for solving the problem. However if planning goes wrong, the code will also be wrong. If any steps of planning provided before programming, then it will be considered as Plan-and-then-Code.\n\nFollowings are the examples of correcting the wrong solutions with a `Workaround Method` based on diagnosis (`Mistakes`) and `Hint for a better Method choice`.\n\n\n\n\n`Question`:\nProblem:\nSubproblem 0: What is the net charge of arginine in a solution of $\\mathrm{pH} 1.0$?\nPlease format your answer as +n or -n.\n`Method`: Plan-and-then-Code (p2c)\n`Attempt 1`:\ndef solution():\n    # pKa values for arginine\n    pKa_carboxyl = 3.0\n    pKa_amino = 8.0\n    pKa_guanidinium = 11.0\n\n    # pH value for the solution\n    pH = 1.0\n\n    # Determine the charge state of each group at pH 1.0\n    charge_carboxyl = 1 if pH > pKa_carboxyl else 0\n    charge_amino = -1 if pH > pKa_amino else 0\n    charge_guanidinium = -1 if pH > pKa_guanidinium else 0\n\n    # Calculate the net charge\n    net_charge = charge_carboxyl - charge_amino - charge_guanidinium\n\n    # Format the net charge\n    formatted_charge = f\"+{net_charge}\" if net_charge >= 0 else f\"{net_charge}\"\n    return formatted_charge\n`Answer 1`: +0\n`Evaluation`: Wrong\n`Mistakes`: The attempt above wrongly calculates the net charge and also uses wrong charges for functional groups. Carboxyl group will not have a positive charge; protonation of the carboxyl group actually neutralizes its charge. Additionally, the guanidinium group already has a positive charge at neutral pH, and this charge does not change at pH 1.0. The amino group does carry a positive charge at low pH.\n`Workaround Method`: Chain of Thought (cot)\n`Attempt 2`:\nArginine is an amino acid with three groups that can be protonated and contribute to its net charge, depending on the solution's pH:\n\n1.

The side chain (guanidinium group, -C(NH2)2+), which has a pKa of approximately 12.48.\n\nAt a pH of 1.0, all three groups are in their protonated forms due to the low pH value being well below their respective pKa values. The carboxyl group would be COOH, the amino group would be NH3+, and the side chain would be protonated as well. The net charge of arginine in this situation is the sum of the charges of these groups:\n\n- The carboxyl group (-COOH) is neutral at this pH.\n- The amino group (-NH3+) carries a charge of +1.\n- The guanidinium group (-C(NH2)2+) carries a charge of +1.\n\nNet charge = 0 (from -COOH) +1 (from -NH3+) +1 (from -C(NH2)2+)\n\nNet charge = +2\n\nThus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +2.\n\nFinal answer: The net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +2.\n`Answer 2`: $2$\n`Evaluation`: Correct\n\n\n\n`Question`:\nProblem:\nSubproblem 0: Let $z = 1 + \\sqrt{3} i$.

Might help correct understanding of the problem but this could be weaker in precise computation.\n- Program-aided Language Modeling (pal): Using python language to reason and obtain an accurate answer to the given question, but this could be weaker in understanding the problem.\n- Plan-and-then-Code (p2c): When a question seems requiring amount of steps to reach the answer, write plans first for what to compute and write a python code to it for solving the problem. However if planning goes wrong, the code will also be wrong. If any steps of planning provided before programming, then it will be considered as Plan-and-then-Code.\n\nFollowings are the examples of correcting the wrong solutions with a `Workaround Method` based on diagnosis (`Mistakes`) and `Hint for a better Method choice`.\n\n\n\n\n`Question`:\nProblem:\nSubproblem 0: What is the net charge of arginine in a solution of $\\mathrm{pH} 1.0$?\nPlease format your answer as +n or -n.\n`Method`: Plan-and-then-Code (p2c)\n`Attempt 1`:\ndef solution():\n    # pKa values for arginine\n    pKa_carboxyl = 3.0\n    pKa_amino = 8.0\n    pKa_guanidinium = 11.0\n\n    # pH value for the solution\n    pH = 1.0\n\n    # Determine the charge state of each group at pH 1.0\n    charge_carboxyl = 1 if pH > pKa_carboxyl else 0\n    charge_amino = -1 if pH > pKa_amino else 0\n    charge_guanidinium = -1 if pH > pKa_guanidinium else 0\n\n    # Calculate the net charge\n    net_charge = charge_carboxyl - charge_amino - charge_guanidinium\n\n    # Format the net charge\n    formatted_charge = f\"+{net_charge}\" if net_charge >= 0 else f\"{net_charge}\"\n    return formatted_charge\n`Answer 1`: +0\n`Evaluation`: Wrong\n`Mistakes`: The attempt above wrongly calculates the net charge and also uses wrong charges for functional groups. Carboxyl group will not have a positive charge; protonation of the carboxyl group actually neutralizes its charge. Additionally, the guanidinium group already has a positive charge at neutral pH, and this charge does not change at pH 1.0. The amino group does carry a positive charge at low pH.\n`Workaround Method`: Chain of Thought (cot)\n`Attempt 2`:\nArginine is an amino acid with three groups that can be protonated and contribute to its net charge, depending on the solution's pH:\n\n1. The carboxyl group (-COOH), which typically has a pKa around 2.17.\n2. The amino group (-NH3+), with a pKa around 9.04.\n3. The side chain (guanidinium group, -C(NH2)2+), which has a pKa of approximately 12.48.\n\nAt a pH of 1.0, all three groups are in their protonated forms due to the low pH value being well below their respective pKa values. The carboxyl group would be COOH, the amino group would be NH3+, and the side chain would be protonated as well. The net charge of arginine in this situation is the sum of the charges of these groups:\n\n- The carboxyl group (-COOH) is neutral at this pH.\n- The amino group (-NH3+) carries a charge of +1.\n- The guanidinium group (-C(NH2)2+) carries a charge of +1.\n\nNet charge = 0 (from -COOH) +1 (from -NH3+) +1 (from -C(NH2)2+)\n\nNet charge = +2\n\nThus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +2.\n\nFinal answer: The net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +2.\n`Answer 2`: $2$\n`Evaluation`: Correct\n\n\n\n`Question`:\nProblem:\nSubproblem 0: Let $z = 1 + \\sqrt{3} i$.
