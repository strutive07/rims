Let's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it,

Question: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?

Answer:
Olivia had 23 dollars.
And she bought 5 bagels.
And each bagel costs 3 dollars.
So she spent 5 * 3 = 15 dollars.
So she has 23 - 15 = 8 dollars left.
So the answer is 8.


Now it's your turn. Here is another math problem:

Answer:
Michael started with 58 golf balls.
And he lost 23 golf balls on tuesday.
So after losing 23 on tuesday, he had 58 -23 = 35.
And then he lost 2 more golf balls on wednesday.
So after losing 2 more on wednesday, he had 35 - 2 = 33 golf balls.
So the answer is 33.



Answer:
There were originally 9 computers.
And 5 more computers were added from monday to thursday.
There are 4 days between monday and thursday.
So 5 * 4 = 20 computers were added in total.
So there are 9 + 20 = 29 computers now.
So the answer is 29.



Answer:
Shawn started with 5 toys.
And he got 2 toys each from his mom and dad.
So he got 2 + 2 = 4 toys.
Therefore, he has 5 + 4 = 9 toys now.
So the answer is 9.



Answer:
Jason started with 20 lollipops.
Then he had 12 after giving some to Denny.
So he gave Denny 20 - 12 = 8 lollipops.
So the answer is 8.



Answer:
There are 15 trees originally.
And there were 21 trees after some more were planted.
So 21 - 15 = 6 trees were planted.
So the answer is 6.



Answer:
There are originally 3 cars.
And 2 more cars arrive.
So there are 3 + 2 = 5 cars now.
So the answer is 5.



Answer:
Originally, Leah had 32 chocolates.
And her sister had 10 more chocolates than her.
So her sister had 42 chocolates.
So in total they had 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates.
Then they ate 35 chocolates.
Therefore they had 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates left.
So the answer is 39.

A square has 4 equal sides.
The perimeter of the square paper is 32 centimeters.
So each side of the square is 32 / 4 = 8 centimeters.
The area of the whole square paper is side * side = 8 * 8 = 64 square centimeters.

Math problem: Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees. She also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. If she buys 2/5 times more of each item, what would be the total number of the items she will have if she currently has 60 marbles?

(A)
Answer:
Bella currently has 60 marbles.
She has two times as many marbles as frisbees, so she has 60 / 2 = 30 frisbees.
She has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, so she has 30 - 20 = 10 deck cards.
Now, she buys 2/5 times more of each item:
For marbles: 60 * (2/5) = 24 more marbles.
For frisbees: 30 * (2/5) = 12 more frisbees.
For deck cards: 10 * (2/5) = 4 more deck cards.
After buying more items, she will have:
Marbles: 60 + 24 = 84 marbles.
Frisbees: 30 + 12 = 42 frisbees.
Deck cards: 10 + 4 = 14 deck cards.
So, the total number of items she will have is 84 + 42 + 14 = 140.

Math problem:: Pump A can fill a tank of water in 5 hours. Pump B can fill the same tank in 15 hours. How many minutes does it take the two pumps working together to fill the tank?

(A)
Answer:
Pump A can fill the tank in 5 hours.
So, Pump A can fill 1/5 of the tank in 1 hour.
Pump B can fill the tank in 15 hours.
So, Pump B can fill 1/15 of the tank in 1 hour.
When both pumps work together, they can fill (1/5 + 1/15) of the tank in 1 hour.
So they can fill (3/15 + 1/15) = 4/15 of the tank in 1 hour.
To convert 4/15 hours to minutes, we multiply by 60:
4/15 * 60 = 16 minutes.
So, the two pumps working together can fill the tank in 16 minutes.
So the answer is 16.

Math problem: You can buy 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price. You bought 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples and watermelons, and the price of 1 orange is $0.50. How much does 1 apple cost if your total bill was $66?

(A)
Answer:
You bought 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples, and watermelons.
So you bought 36 / 3 = 12 of each fruit.
You bought 12 oranges and each orange costs $0.50.
So the cost of the oranges is 12 * $0.50 = $6.
Your total bill was $66, and the cost of the oranges was $6.
So the cost of the apples and watermelons combined is $66 - $6 = $60.
Assuming the price of watermelon is W, the price of one apple is A.
Knowing that you can buy 4 apples for the same price and that the price of one apple is A, then 1W=4A.
So we have the equation:
12A + 12W = $60 (total cost of apples and watermelons)
12A + 12(4A) = $60
60 A = $60
Then we know the price of one apple is A = $1
So the answer is 1.

(B)
def solution():
    total_fruits = 36
    total_bill = 66
    orange_price = 0.50
    fruits_per_type = total_fruits // 3
    oranges_cost = fruits_per_type * orange_price
    apples_watermelons_cost = total_bill - oranges_cost

    apple_price_ratio = 4
    watermelon_price_ratio = 1
    total_ratio = apple_price_ratio + watermelon_price_ratio

    apple_cost =  apple_price_ratio * (apples_watermelons_cost / total_ratio)
    apple_price = apple_cost / fruits_per_type

    return remaining_amount

Which of the above three choices can correctly answer the math problem?

(A) can correctly answer the math problem. Because (B) adds the number of bagels to the cost of each bagel instead of multiplying them, and (C) also fails by wrongly subtracting num_bagels from original_amount.

Now it's your turn. Here is another math problem and three choices.
Math Problem: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?

(A)
Answer:
Michael started with 58 golf balls.
Then after losing 23 on tuesday, he had 58 -23 = 35.
After losing 2 more, he had 35 + 2 = 37 golf balls.
So the answer is 37.

(B)
def solution():
    golf_balls_initial = 58
    golf_balls_lost_tuesday = 23
    golf_balls_lost_wednesday = 2
    golf_balls_left = golf_balls_initial - golf_balls_lost_tuesday + golf_balls_lost_wednesday
    result = golf_balls_left
    return result

(C)

    '''
    Create a function solution that returns the answer of the following question: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?

    Let's think step by step.
    1. Initialize the variable `golf_balls` with the initial number of golf balls.
    2. Subtract the number of golf balls lost on Tuesday and Wednesday.
    3. Return the remaining number of golf balls.
    '''
    # Step 1: Initialize the variable `golf_balls` with the initial number of golf balls
    golf_balls = 58

    # Step 2: Subtract the number of golf balls lost on Tuesday (23) and Wednesday (2)
    golf_balls -= 23  # golf balls lost on Tuesday
    golf_balls -= 2   # golf balls lost on Wednesday

    # Step 3: Return the remaining number of golf balls
    return golf_balls

Math problem: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?

(A)
Answer:
There were originally 9 computers.
For each of 4 days from monday to thursday, 5 more computers were added, that is, total 5 computers added for 4 days.
So there are 9 + 5 = 14 computers now.
So the answer is 14.

(B)
def solution():
    computers_initial = 9
    computers_per_day = 5
    num_days = 4
    computers_added = computers_per_day * num_days
    computers_total = computers_initial + computers_added
    result = computers_total
    return result

(C)
def solution():
    '''
    Create a function solution that returns the answer of the following question: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?

    Let's think step by step.
    1. Calculate the total number of computers installed from Monday to Thursday: 5 computers/day * 3 days = 15
    2. Add the initial 9 computers to the total: 9 + 15 = 24
    3. There are now 24 computers in the server room.
    '''
    return 9 + 5 * 3
