      Let's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it,

      Problem:
      Subproblem 0: What is the net charge of arginine in a solution of $\mathrm{pH} 1.0$?
      Please format your answer as +n or -n.

      Solution:
      Arginine is an amino acid with three groups that can be protonated and contribute to its net charge, depending on the solution's pH:\n\n1. The carboxyl group (-COOH), which typically has a pKa around 2.17.\n2. The amino group (-NH3+), with a pKa around 9.04.\n3. The side chain (guanidinium group, -C(NH2)2+), which has a pKa of approximately 12.48.\n\nAt a pH of 1.0, all three groups are in their protonated forms due to the low pH value being well below their respective pKa values. The carboxyl group would be COOH, the amino group would be NH3+, and the side chain would be protonated as well. The net charge of arginine in this situation is the sum of the charges of these groups:\n\n- The carboxyl group (-COOH) is neutral at this pH.\n- The amino group (-NH3+) carries a charge of +1.\n- The guanidinium group (-C(NH2)2+) carries a charge of +1.\n\nNet charge = 0 (from -COOH) +1 (from -NH3+) +1 (from -C(NH2)2+)\n\nNet charge = +2\n\nThus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +2.\n\nFinal answer: The net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +2.


      Now it's your turn. Here is another math problem:
      Problem:
      Preamble: For each Laplace Transform \(Y(s)\), find the function \(y(t)\):
      Subproblem 0:
      \[Y(s)=\boxed{\frac{1}{(s+a)(s+b)}}\]
    - |
      Problem:
      Preamble: The following subproblems refer to the differential equation
      $\ddot{x}+b \dot{x}+x=0$.
      Subproblem 0: What is the characteristic polynomial $p(s)$ of
      $\ddot{x}+b \dot{x}+x=0$?
    - |
      Problem:
      Subproblem 0: Let $z = 1 + \sqrt{3} i$. Find $a, b$ that satisfy the equation
      $z^4 = a + bi$. Express your answer as the ordered pair $(a,b)$.
  assistant:
    - |
      Solution:
      We can simplify with partial fractions:
      \[Y(s)=\\frac{1}{(s+a)(s+b)}=\\frac{C}{s+a}+\\frac{D}{s+b}\]\nfind the constants
      \(C\) and \(D\) by setting \(s=-a\) and \(s=-b\)
      \[
        \begin{aligned}
        \frac{1}{(s+a)(s+b)} &=\\frac{C}{s+a}+\\frac{D}{s+b} \\\\
        1 &=C(s+b)+D(s+a) \\
        C &=\\frac{1}{b-a} \\
        D &=\\frac{1}{a-b}
        \end{aligned}
      \]
      therefore
      \[\nY(s)=\frac{1}{b-a} \frac{1}{s+a}-\frac{1}{b-a} \frac{1}{s+b}
      \]
      By looking up the inverse Laplace Transform of \(\frac{1}{s+b}\), we find the total
      solution \(y(t)\)
      \[
        y(t)=\boxed{\frac{1}{b-a}\left(e^{-a t}-e^{-b t}\right)}
      \].
      Final answer: The final answer is \[\frac{1}{b-a}\left(e^{-a t}-e^{-b t}\right)\]. I hope it is correct.
    - |
      Solution:
      The characteristic polynomial is $p(s)=\\boxed{s^{2}+b s+1}$.
      Final answer: The final answer is $s^{2}+b s+1$. I hope it is correct.
    - |
      Solution:
      $z^{4}$ has argument $4 \pi / 3$ and radius 16 , so it's equal to $-8-8 \sqrt{3} i$.
      Thus $a = -8, b = -8\sqrt 3$, and our answer is $\boxed{(-8, -8\sqrt{3})}$.
      Final answer: The final answer is (-8, -8\sqrt{3}). I hope it is correct.

      Let's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it,

      Problem:
      Find the domain of the expression  $\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}$.}

      Solution:
      The expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore, $x-2 \ge 0$, so $x\ge2$, and $5 - x \ge 0$, so $x \le 5$. Also, the denominator cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain of the expression is $\boxed{[2,5)}$.
      Final Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$. I hope it is correct.


      Now it's your turn. Here is another math problem:
      Problem:
      If $\det \mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\det \mathbf{B} = 12,$ then find $\det (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}).$
    - |
      Problem:
      Terrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?
    - |
      Problem:
      If the system of equations

      \begin{align*}
      6x-4y&=a,\\
      6y-9x &=b.
      \end{align*}has a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,
      find $\frac{a}{b},$ assuming $b$ is nonzero.
  assistant:
    - |
      Solution:
      We have that $\det (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}) = (\det \mathbf{A})(\det \mathbf{B}) = (2)(12) = \boxed{24}.$
      Final Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.
    - |
      Solution:
      If Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of $2\cdot 12\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\cdot15\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:
      \begin{align*}
      30n&=480\\
      \Rightarrow\qquad n&=480/30=\boxed{16}
      \end{align*}
      Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.
    - |
      Solution:
      If we multiply the first equation by $-\frac{3}{2}$, we obtain

      $$6y-9x=-\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$, we have

      $$-\frac{3}{2}a=b\Rightarrow\frac{a}{b}=\boxed{-\frac{2}{3}}.$$
      Final Answer: The final answer is $-\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.

      There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today.After they are done, there will be 21 trees.
      How many trees did the grove workers plant today?

      Solution:
      We start with 15 trees. 
      Later we have 21 trees.
      The difference must be the number of trees they planted.
      So, they must have planted 21 - 15 = 6 trees.
      Final Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct.

      Final Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct.
    - |
      Solution:
      Leah had 32 chocolates and Leah's sister had 42.
      That means there were originally 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates.
      35 have been eaten.

      Solution:
      Jason had 20 lollipops.
      Since he only has 12 now, he must have given the rest to Denny.
